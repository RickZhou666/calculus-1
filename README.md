2. setup env
```bash
$ pyenv local 3.10.4
$ python3.10 -m venv .venv
```

3. typeError
```log
TypeError: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars
np.sqrt()
```

# 2. Limits & Continuity - Definition of limit
1. definition of limits
    - the limit as x approach to a function of equal to L

2. one-sided limits
    - general limit
    - LHL - left hand limit
    - RHL - right hand limit
    - general limit can possibly exist when LHL exist, RHL exist and LHL=RHL

3. proving that the limit does not exist
    - DNE, does not exist

4. precise definition of limit
    - we want to a small interval of 𝜺 to get close to L, then get a small interval 𝜹 to get close to the x.
    - as we approach to a, the function is approaching to L
    - The precise definition of the limit proves that the limit exists and is L, as long as any number we pick between a - 𝜹 and a + 𝜹 will always return a value between L - 𝜺 and L + 𝜺
